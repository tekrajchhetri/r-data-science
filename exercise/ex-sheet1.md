# Exercise 1

1. The code below generates a matrix. Find the length of the matrix. Your code should print the following statement "The length of matrix X = length".
  ```r
      X  <- matrix(17:32, nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE) 
  ```
2. Write a program without using functions that check if a given date (year) is a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) or not? 

3. Rewrite the previous programme (Q2) to use functions to determine whether a given year is a leap year.
4. Rewrite the previous programme (Q1) to use functions.
5. Create a programme that prints even or odd numbers based on user input from the matrix. 
    ```r
      evenodd <- function(whichMatrix, whatToPrint){
          #write code
       }
   ```
  
 Even or odd numbers should be returned from matrix **whichMatrix** and printed based on the value of the **whatToPrint** argument.
